## ⚠️ First-Time Setup: Granting Permissions

Since this project uses **Google Apps Script**, Google will ask you to **authorize** it the first time.

### Why?

Apps Script needs permission to:
- Read and update the spreadsheet (move the snake)
- Show input boxes (for your name when you get a high score)
- Store game data using Script Properties

### ✅ Steps to Authorize

1. Click **“Snake Game → PlayGame”**
2. A Google authorization prompt will appear
3. Click **“Continue”**
4. Choose your Google Account
5. Click **“Allow”** to grant access

> 🔒 This script only runs inside your own spreadsheet. No data is sent anywhere.
